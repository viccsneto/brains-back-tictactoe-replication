# Implementation Report

> A concise summary for the reviewer.

**Reviewer note**: If a PR modifies `brainsback/TODO.md` or `brainsback/REACTO.md`, assume this is expected and that those files were modified by the human developer.
If present, use `.github/agents/brainsback-reviewer.md` as the review rubric.

## Snapshot
- **Change**: Replaced X and O symbols with 🐱 (cat) and 🐶 (dog) emojis throughout the tic-tac-toe game
- **Status**: Implementation complete, tests passing

## The Changes
- [x] **game.js** - Updated core game logic to use emojis
  - Line 15: Changed initial player from 'X' to '🐱'
  - Line 26: Updated player toggle logic (`'🐱' ⟷ '🐶'`)
  - Lines 22-23, 34, 49: Updated JSDoc type annotations for documentation
  
- [x] **script.js** - Fixed UI rendering to handle emojis
  - Lines 15-16: Added emoji-to-CSS-class mapping (🐱 → 'cat', 🐶 → 'dog')
  - Removed `.toLowerCase()` call which doesn't work with emojis
  
- [x] **style.css** - Removed player-specific color styles
  - Removed `.cell.x` and `.cell.o` CSS rules
  - Emojis use their native colors, so player-specific styling is no longer needed
  
- [x] **index.html** - Updated initial status message
  - Line 31: Changed "Player X's turn" to "Player 🐱's turn"
  
- [x] **tests/game.test.js** - Updated all test cases
  - Line 8: Fixed `boardFrom()` helper to use `Array.from()` instead of `split('')` for proper emoji handling
  - All test expectations updated from 'X'/'O' to '🐱'/'🐶'

## Testing Strategy
_How we ensured it works._

- **Unit Tests**: All existing Jest tests updated to validate emoji-based game logic
  - `createInitialState()` tests verify starting player is '🐱'
  - `getNextPlayer()` tests verify '🐱' ⟷ '🐶' toggle
  - `checkWinner()` tests verify winner detection with emojis
  - Draw scenario tests verify tie detection with emoji boards
  
- **Critical Fix**: Identified and resolved Unicode handling issue in `boardFrom()` test helper
  - Problem: `split('')` breaks multi-byte emoji characters into invalid UTF-16 code units
  - Solution: Use `Array.from()` to properly handle multi-byte Unicode characters

## Risks & Follow-up
- [x] **Emoji Display**: Emojis rely on system/browser font support
  - Risk: May render differently or show as boxes on older systems
  - Mitigation: Modern browsers and OS have good emoji support
  
- [x] **CSS Class Mapping**: Introduced manual emoji-to-class translation
  - Trade-off: Less flexible than generic `.toLowerCase()` approach
  - Benefit: Clean, semantic CSS class names ('cat', 'dog')
  
- [ ] **Future Enhancement**: If more player symbols are added, consider a config-driven mapping system
